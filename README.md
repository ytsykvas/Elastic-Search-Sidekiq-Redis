This project is for learning Sidekiq, Redis and CRON.

1) learn scheduled tasks with CRON and Sidekiq
2) learn about cashing with Redis
3) create own CSS styles

I used:
1) PostgreSQL, Rails 7.1.2, ruby 3.2.2.
2) SLIM templates against ERB
3) Gem 'SimpleForm' for my forms
4) Redis + Sidekiq + CRON for background jobs
5) Bootstrap and own CSS for styles
6) gem "will_paginate" for pagination
7) gem "faker" for seeding DB
8) Redis for cashing data
9) used gem "rubocop" as a linter

Some files that are normally ignored in GIT will not be ignored for the sake of clarity.
